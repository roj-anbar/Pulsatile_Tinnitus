"""
To convert HDF5 timestep files into a single XDMF time‚Äêseries for visualization in ParaView.

This script:
  1. Finds all .h5 files matching a pattern and sorts them by timestep.
  2. Reads the mesh geometry (points + topology) from the first file.
  3. Writes out a single `output.xdmf` containing all point and cell data at each timestep, so it can be opened in ParaView.

Usage:
  python h5_to_xdmf.py
